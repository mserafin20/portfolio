                <h3 class=>Hello there! My name is Mike and I'm an up and coming web developer. I am currently enrolled in the
                    LPS coding bootcamp though UPenn, and work part time at a chemical manufacturing facility that
                    produces cleaning and disinfectant chemicals. Even though web development is a big change from a
                    warehouse position, I'm excited about the potential opportunities and future project's I'll work on!
